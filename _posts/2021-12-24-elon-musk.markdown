A fascinating look into the private and very public life of South African-born entrepreneur Elon Musk.

I learned about his Canadian family roots: A grandfather that decided to emigrate to South Africa from Canada in the 1950â€™s and who flew his own
biplane all the way there.

I learned that I want him to succeed in his efforts to produce a mass market electric car with Tesla and wean the world of its fossil fuel dependency.

I want him to succeed in his efforts to put humans on Mars.

I also learned that I probably do not want to work for him as he expects huge commitments from employees that put the company
ahead of the birth of a child for one.

The book was released in 2015 and unfortunately, this means that the book itself kind of ends halfway through the story of Elon Musk, SpaceX, Tesla
and Solar City.
