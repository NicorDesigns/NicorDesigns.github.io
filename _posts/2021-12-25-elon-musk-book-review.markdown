[Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25541028-elon-musk): [Ashlee Vance](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/761595.Ashlee_Vance)


My rating: [5 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1843649943)

A fascinating look into the private and very public life of South African-born entrepreneur Elon Musk.

I learned about his Canadian family roots: A grandfather that decided to emigrate to South Africa from Canada in the 1950’s and who flew his own 
biplane all the way there.

I learned that I want him to succeed in his efforts to produce a mass market electric car with Tesla and wean the world of its fossil fuel dependency.

I want him to succeed in his efforts to put humans on Mars.

I also learned that I probably do not want to work for him as he expects huge commitments from employees that put the company 
ahead of the birth of a child for one.

The book was released in 2015 and unfortunately, this means that the book itself kind of ends halfway through the story of Elon Musk, SpaceX, Tesla 
and Solar City.

A lot has happened since the publication of the book:

The Falcon 9 is running into trouble:

The Tesla Model S was the world’s best-selling electric car in 2016
