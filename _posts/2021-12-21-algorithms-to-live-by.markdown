This is a review of the Audio-book which is read by the author.

If you have a background in Computer Science and work as a software engineer this book is a great refresher on College 
level Computer Science Algorithms used mostly in Operating Systems and Network Optimization.

The fun part is how you can apply these algorithms to solve everyday problems such as searching for a parking spot in a 
busy downtown area or what to do when interviewing for a new job.

This is but one example of many.

I enjoyed listening to the audio-book during my daily commute and bought the e-book to do a more detailed study, in 
order to see where and what will work.
