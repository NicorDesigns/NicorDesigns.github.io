The annual volunteer International Coastal cleanup takes place every year:

Each year the data collected gets more sophisticated:

Now think about it this way:

This huge pile of thoughtless discarded trash produced by us are a huge stream of consumer data that are currently not monetized.

At the front end of this consumer data collection point we currently have the behemoths like Google , Facebook 
and Amazon building data profiles on each one of us.

Currently, here at the ugly back end where trash gets thoughtlessly discarded, nobody is currently collecting data about 
the consumer for monetary purposes, the next world global data collection giant might be very well be built on 
mountains of garbage.

Imagine a data profile of a city blocks publicly discarded trash.

Would you allow someone to pay you if they can collect your trash and sort through it? 

Wonâ€™t the cigarette companies want to know on what beach in the world they can find most of their smokers or the 
soft drink companies want to know what drinks are being consumed where in the world?

Imagine constant collection of discarded trash in the public domain that gets tagged with metadata that can be sold on 
to commercial agency for advertising, the metadata can also be used to organize the flow of discarded trash to 
purposeful recycling and re-purposing.

So where are we now ?
